### Predicting Metal Product Lifespan Using Machine Learning Techniques

### Overview ###
This project which focuses on predicting the lifespan of metal products manufactured with a new metal alloy. By leveraging supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, the project aims to assist the metal parts manufacturing company in refining their production process and addressing defects efficiently.

---

### Key Objectives
- Estimate the lifespan of metal parts using processing parameters.
- Avoid costly and destructive lifespan measurement techniques.
- Improve production quality by identifying and addressing defects.
---

### Machine Learning Methods
The following techniques were applied:

***Regression***

1. Linear Regression

2. Support Vector Regressor

3. Random Forest Regressor: Achieved 97.82% accuracy.

***Binary Classification***

1. Logistic Regression

2. Support Vector Classifier

3. Random Forest Classifier: Achieved 94% accuracy
  


***Clustering***

***KMeans Clustering:***

Grouped product lifespan into four clusters based on defect sizes.
